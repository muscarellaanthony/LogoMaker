# Logo Maker

## Description
This was my first project using the command line interface to prompt users for information and generate something with their answers. Specifically, users answers questins about how they want a logo designed and their answers are imported from the inquirer and used to generate an html file with their logo printed in the window.

## Installation
For this app, you will need node.js installed and will need to open the repository in a code editor with an accesible terminal.

## Usage
In order to use this module, you will have to go into your terminal and run "node index.js". From there follow the promtps and open the html file in a browser after it is generated.
